# ENVI-met webReader: Advanced Environmental Data Analysis and Visualization for EDX/EDT Files

## Abstract

The **ENVI-met webReader** is a cutting-edge web-based solution designed for advanced environmental data analysis and visualization of **EDX/EDT files** produced by [ENVI-met](https://envi-met.com). Built on a **modular ES6 framework**, it offers a robust and adaptable architecture for seamless integration of various components and future scalability.

The user interface focuses on **user experience**, offering **light and dark mode** options and a comprehensive feature set for efficient data management, representation, and comparative analysis. Key capabilities include:

- **Sophisticated data manipulation** tools (filtering, aggregation, statistical analysis).
- **Powerful visualization** components (charts, 3D renderings, interactive maps).
- **Comparative analysis** tools for juxtaposing datasets and deriving insights.
- **Advanced EDX/EDT file management**, enabling streamlined upload, organization, and access.

Integration with [**ECharts**](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) elevates the user experience, providing dynamic, interactive visualizations such as line graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps. The system is optimized through **data caching** and **performance techniques** for a smooth, responsive user experience.

Designed for **environmental scientists, urban planners, and decision-makers**, the ENVI-met webReader is a robust tool for handling complex environmental data.

## Limitations

While the ENVI-met webReader provides robust tools for environmental data analysis, there are a few limitations to consider:

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Currently, the application is fully compatible only with **Chrome** and **Chromium-based browsers**. Compatibility with other browsers will be addressed in future updates.

2. **Technology Stack**
   - The project is built using **pure JavaScript**, avoiding frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. While this ensures simplicity, it may limit scalability and ease of maintenance compared to modern framework-based approaches.

3. **Feature Availability**
   - Not all features described in this document are currently available. Many advanced functionalities, such as **wind integration**, **terrain following**, and certain comparative tools, are planned for **future development** and will be added in subsequent releases.

These limitations highlight the project's ongoing nature, with planned updates to address compatibility, feature expansion, and enhanced architecture.
